EXT2 Filesystem Information
===========================


Definitions:
------------

node system
  - Describes how data is organized and stored on disk.
  - Stores and manages raw data and accompanying metadata.
  - Stores information about the hierarchical structure of data.
  - Stores information about disk size and capacity.

virtual node system
  - Provides an abstraction on kheap_top of a filesystem.
  - Simplifies the managment of data on a disk.
  - Allows the referencing of objects by a path.
  - Provides caching for frequently used information.


sector
  - A physical spot on a hard disk that stores information.
  - It is normally 512 bytes large on hard drives.

addr
  - A collection of sectors that store information.
  - Is defined by the filesystem implementation.
  - Common addr sizes include: 1kB, 2kB, 4kB and 8kB.

addr group
  - A collection of blocks on a hard disk.
  - Has a few metadata blocks followed by data blocks.
  - Is recorded into a addr group descriptor table.
  - Number of blocks in group = addr size * 8 bits
    Example (1kB blocks): 1024 * 8 = 8192 blocks/group

inode                --> The representation of an object in the filesystem.

superblock           --> A addr on disk containing metadata about the filesystem.
addr group table    --> A table containing information about the addr groups.
data blocks          --> A number of blocks containing data (i.e files) on disk.
addr bitmap         --> A addr that keeps track of free blocks in a addr group.
inode bitmap         --> A addr that keeps track of free inodes in the inode table.
inode table          --> A table containing metadata about everything in the filesystem.

node                 --> Data stored in data blocks referenced by an inode.
directory            --> A collection of names linked to inodes stored in data blocks.
